# MentalHealthAwarness

## Overview
The given code demonstrates a basic web application built using the Flask framework. This application is centered around raising awareness about mental health and provides functionality for users to read articles on mental health, submit comments on articles, and contact the administrators of the site for assistance or inquiries.

## How It Works:
When a user accesses the root URL (/), they are presented with the main article on mental health.
The user can navigate to other sections of the site using the navigation links.
If a user wishes to share their thoughts on the article, they can submit a comment. Upon submission, the comment is stored in the comments list and is immediately displayed below the article.
The user can also visit the "About" page to learn more about the helpline.
If a user wants to contact the helpline, they can fill out the contact form. Once the form is submitted, they receive a flash message and are redirected to a page confirming the successful submission of their message.
Throughout the application, visual content (like images) is utilized to make the content engaging and relatable.

## Conclusion:
The application provides a straightforward interface for users to learn about mental health, share their thoughts, and contact a helpline for support. It's a fundamental implementation and can be extended with features like persistent storage for comments (using databases), user authentication, and richer content management, among others.
